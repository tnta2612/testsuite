# QUIC Security Consideration Testsuite

This repository provides a test suite for validating the security mechanisms of QUIC servers for the security considerations outlined in [RFC 9000](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000).

The test suite supports various QUIC server implementations and is containerized using Docker, with Dockerfiles provided for each server. Note that running the suite requires `sudo` privileges for network traffic analysis and `iptables` configurations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:

1. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential libnetfilter-queue-dev
   ```
2. **Python 3.x**
3. **Docker** (with `sudo` privileges)
4. **tshark**

### Additional Setup

To switch to root:
```bash
sudo -i
```

## Project Structure

- **`build_docker_images.sh`**: Builds Docker images for the QUIC servers.
- **`setup.py`**: Runs the QUIC servers, sets up AIOQUIC client and the Python virtual environment.
- **`testsuite.py`**: Runs the test cases for security considerations.
- **`cleanup.py`**: Stops running Docker containers and cleans up generated (log) files.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Build Docker Images

```bash
./build_docker_images.sh
```
> *Note*: Initial builds may take time if images arenâ€™t cached.

### 2. Start QUIC Servers and Set Up the AIOQUIC Client

To start the QUIC servers in Docker containers, specify the server names and ports:

```bash
python3 setup.py chromium:6001,aioquic:6002,lsquic:6003,msquic:6004,mvfst:6005,neqo:6006,ngtcp2:6007,picoquic:6008,quic-go:6009,quiche:6010,quinn:6011
```
> This command launches Docker containers with each specified server listening on the given ports.

To run a single QUIC server:
```bash
python3 setup.py chromium:6001
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment for `aioquic`:

```bash
source ./aioquic/venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Python Dependencies

Install required Python packages:

```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run Test Cases

To run tests on multiple specified servers, use:

```bash
python3 testsuite.py chromium:6001,aioquic:6002,lsquic:6003,msquic:6004,mvfst:6005,neqo:6006,ngtcp2:6007,picoquic:6008,quic-go:6009,quiche:6010,quinn:6011
```

For testing a single server, use:

```bash
python3 testsuite.py chromium:6001
```

### Sample Output

The test suite will output analysis results for each server. Review the results to determine the susceptibility of each server to specific attacks. Following is a sample output:
